## Description

This is a web-based HTML form for student enrollment using JsonPowerDB as the database. JsonPowerDB is a real-time, high-performance, lightweight, and simple-to-use REST API-based multi-mode DBMS. It has ready-to-use APIs for JSON document DB, RDBMS, key-value DB, geospatial DB, and time series DB functionality. JPDB supports and advocates for true serverless and pluggable API development.

This project allows users to perform CRUD operations on student enrollment data. CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. Users can create new student records, read existing records, update records, and delete records.

This project is useful for educational institutions that want to manage their student enrollment data in a more efficient and effective way. It can also be used for other purposes, such as online examination registration, job application, and profile creation.
